# scissors-paper-rock

code for the odin project's game: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-rock-paper-scissors

## remaining issues

⬜️ If player makes an in an invalid input at first before finalising the right answer, this invalid input transfers into the final report as 'undefined' - the program doesn't record the input that's actually accepted

```
You have chosen Paper
Computer has chosen Scissors
Computer Wins! Scissors beats undefined
Scoreboard | YOU: 2 | COMPUTER: 2
```
## extra stuff 
⬜️ would be cool to have something like a game MC lol
```
  if gameCount === 1 {
    alert("Get ready to play ..."); 
  }
  if gameCount === 5 {
    alert("Final round, here we go!");
  }
```

⬜️ input an alert or some kind of response if player decides to end game pre-maturely i.e. if they click cancel on the prompt
// message: see you next time!
