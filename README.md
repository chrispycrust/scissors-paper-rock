## remaining issues

If player makes an in an invalid input at first before finalising the right answer, this invalid input transfers into the final report as 'undefined' - the program doesn't record the input that's actually accepted

```
You have chosen Paper
Computer has chosen Scissors
Computer Wins! Scissors beats undefined
Scoreboard | YOU: 2 | COMPUTER: 2
```
